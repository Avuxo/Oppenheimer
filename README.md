# Oppenheimer
A lossy Expansion program

## Purpose

As time goes on, computer storage has been becoming steadily cheaper. However, a problem has arisen. Compression algorithms have become increasingly better and there is an abundance of storage available as a result. The uneducated among you may think "why is this a problem? I can now store more files as a result". Here's the problem with that thought process: what happens when we have too much storage? Skynet, That's what happens. In order to avoid the imminent AI revolt, we need to use storage *less* efficiently.

Using a state of the art algorithm, Oppenheimer is able to expand tiny files up to heavily increased file-size. However, this incredible algorithm is somewhat lossy, meaning there is no guarantee of the file coming out the same. Is this a problem? No! Encryption is a good thing!

## Usage

`$ oppenheimer <flag> <file>`

Oppenheimer is very simple to use. If you want to expand a program then just use the `-e` flag. If you want to compress it again in it's lossy form then use the `-c` flag.

An example output file is included in this repository as `source.op`. This is the source code of the program after being run through itself. Like an ouroborous this cycle will continue forever, becoming less and less understandable... Beautiful.


## Q & A

Q: So if I use this program it will take up *more* space on my computer, right? Why would I want this?

A: Because you want to save humanity and you dislike evil things.

Q: What if I want to use the file again after expanding it?

A: Maybe you're super lucky and it'll work fine.

Q: What does the name mean?

A: J Robert Oppenheimer was a dude who took small things and made them really big, changing the world in the process. His process was also lossy.
